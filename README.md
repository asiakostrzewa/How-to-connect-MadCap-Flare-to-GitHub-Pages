Your local project has been uploaded to your GitHub repository.

## Step 2. Project preparing for publication on GitHub Pages

1. In your MadCap Flare, click **Project Organizer** > **Targets** > **HTML5** > **General** and change 'home.htm' to 'index.html' in **Output File** section.

Save changes.

2. Create a new Publishing Destination using **Project Organizer** > **Targets** > **HTML5** > **Publishing** > **New Destination...** and clicking **Add**.

3. Create a target folder "Docs" in your local project. It should be in the main directory of the project that we bind with Git.

![Create a target folder](./Resources/Target-folder.png) 

> [!CAUTION]
> The name of the target folder is case-sensitive.
> 
> Example: if you named the folder "Docs" - enter the name in capital letter. If you used "docs", then enter lowercase letters.

4. Choose Source Control type and provide the target folder destination.

Save your work.

5. Go back to the **Project Organizer** > **Targets** > **HTML5** > **Publishing** menu and select **Publish** checkbox.

Save changes and click **Publish**.

The output with your completed website should jump into the folder you just selected (in my case: "Docs").

>[!NOTE]
> From now on, in the "Source Control" menu (at the top, in the taskbar), you will find standard Git operations - commit, pull and push.
> 
> Now you can change the local files in your MadCap project, commit the changes and push them to the remote repository.
